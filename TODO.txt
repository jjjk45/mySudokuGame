    -Make UI pretty -- Add hamburger menu that folds downward when you press a symbol in the top-left
        - Options
            - Screenshake on errors
            - # of errors allowed before forced reset
            - Celebration on puzzle completion
        - Hints -- limit to 3
            - implement it so the tile with the most possible choices is told
        - Special sudoku puzzles - not random, prefilled famous versions, maybe even impossible versions
    -Add debug mode
        - add tracker that shows how many masks/empty spaces were added, its not always feasible to have <~25 clues
        - add console.log -- board, solutions, and mask application time
    -Add unit tests
    -Add enclosures to obscure sudoku generation logic
    -Add stopwatch
    -Add notes functionality
    -Add more function hints for readability
    -Make program behavior more readable with better function ordering
    -I want to add seeds for random boards and ideally implement it with a leaderboard for who solved a seed the fastest/with the least errors
        - maybe add users and include how many they've solved
